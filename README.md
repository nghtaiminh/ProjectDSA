# Minesweeper

This is a simple implementation of the Minesweeper game using Java. In this project, I  got to strengthen my Java coding skills with Object-Oriented Programming, Data Structures and Algorithms

## Features

- Basic features: left-click to reveal a cell, right-click to flag, timer, and restart
- Apply a queue-based implementation of BFS to reveal empty cells 
- Difficulty: Easy, Medium, Hard
- Undo: Allow to return the previous state of the minefield when clicking on a  mine
- Not loss on the first click
